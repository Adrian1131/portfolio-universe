    How did I even get into programming and tech in the first place?
    In community college I found out about it, and thought I should give it a try.
    I started learning Java and Python, after that I went deeper into the world of programming.
    I found out how powerful programming can be, and how it can change the world.
    So that is when I really decided to go all the way and get a degree in Computer Science.
    I have a passion for solving problems, and want to innovate and assist in businesses with my skills.`,

    description: `
    Welcome to Earth! Let me tell you a bit about myself.
    I am from Ansonia, Connecticut, USA, and I am an aspiring data engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through data-driven solutions.
    Currently, I am a senior at Southern Connecticut State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic journey has deepened my interest in data engineering, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects in this field.
    I am actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities in data engineering to apply my skills in managing, transforming, and optimizing data pipelines. Additionally, I am looking for a mentor to guide me as I continue to grow in this ever-evolving discipline.
    While I appreciate the importance of front-end development, my true passion lies in back-end systems and data engineering. I believe that data is the foundation of modern technologyâ€”it's the fuel driving decisions, innovation, and the future.
    Let's build something transformative together!

    I am in the process of refining my GitHub account, and making it more professional. I have tried using a bunch of different languages,
    my main focus is in Python, C++, and databases. I have also started to use Git more, and have been learning how to use it more effectively.
    I intend on having more data focused projects on there like pipelines, and data analysis. I am also looking to contribute to open source projects,`,
